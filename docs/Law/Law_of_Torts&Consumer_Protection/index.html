        <h3 id="what">Tort</h3>
        <dl>A tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm.</dl>
        <dl><strong>Tort is no codified(Written) Law</strong></dl>
        <dd>Each case has new characteristics. It also evolves with changes in society and the demands for justice.<br>
            In India, the law of torts is mainly judge-made, which means that the principles of tort law have been developed 
            by judges through their decisions in cases</dd>

        <dl><strong>4 essential elements of torts (all 4 essential elements of a tort must be proven)</strong></dl>
            <dt>Duty: A legal responsibility that one person or entity owes to another.<br>
                Breach of duty: The failure to fulfill this obligation.<br>
                Causation(relationship between cause and effect): The connection between the breach and the harm or damages suffered.<br>
                Injury: The plaintiff must establish that the breach of duty caused the plaintiff's injury and losses.<br>
                <i><u>If any of these elements is missing, the tort cannot be established, and damages cannot be awarded</u></i>
            </dt>
            <br>
        <dl><strong>Circumstances in which liability of tort is discharged</strong></dl>
            <dt>
                1. Death of the parties: The tort ends when the parties die. This can include the death of the wronged person or the wrongdoer<br>
                2. Waiver: This occurs when an injured person has more than one remedy for a tort and chooses one of them.<br>
                3. Accord and satisfaction: This is a mutual agreement between the injured person and the wrongdoer.<br>
                4. Release: This is when the aggrieved person gives up their entire claim or right against the wrongdoer. <br>
                5. Acquiescence:<br>
                6. Judgment recovered:<br>
                7. Statutes of limitation:<br>
            </dt>
            <br>
        <dl><strong>Damages that may be awarded in a tort</strong></dl>
            <dt>Damages in tort are monetary awards given to a plaintiff to compensate for loss or injury. 
                The goal of damages is to restore the plaintiff to the position they would have been in if the tort had not occurred</dt>

                - Imposing liability on a superior person provides an appropriate

                - The Bhopal Gas Tragedy(1984) and the Oleum gas Leak case(1986) led the Supreme Court of India to develop a new law. 
                In the Bhopal Gas Tragedy case, the court used the "Absolute Liability" doctrine to hold the corporation accountable 
                and order it to compensate the victims
