                - The Bhopal Gas Tragedy(1984) and the Oleum gas Leak case(1986) led the Supreme Court of India to develop a new law. 
                In the Bhopal Gas Tragedy case, the court used the "Absolute Liability" doctrine to hold the corporation accountable 
                and order it to compensate the victims
