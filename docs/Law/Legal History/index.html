            Mixture of English common law, Portuguese law, and local customs might be applied.<br>
            Lack of a codified legal system created confusion and inconsistency.

             and heavily influenced by the EIC's commercial interests.
        </dd>

        </dd>
        <h4>(1664-1687)Development of Judicial Structures</h4>
        <dd>
            <u>Formalizing Judicial Processes:</u><br>

            handling serious criminal cases and disputes involving local Indian merchants. <br>
            - Faujdari Courts: Serious criminal offenses and significant disputes were referred to the Mughal faujdari (criminal) courts

        <h2>1772. Warren Hastings' Judicial Plan</h2>
        <dl>
            Warren Hastings was appointed as the Governor of Bengal<br>
            Administration and judicial systems in Bengal were inefficient and corrupt, necessitating reforms
        </dl>
        <h4>Key features</h4>
        <dl>
            1. Merged Revenue and judicial functions which was causing confusion and corruption<br>
            2. Created civil court:<br>
            &ensp; <b>Diwani Adalats(in each district)</b> presided over by European officers called Collectors.<br>
            &ensp; <b>Sadar Diwani Adalat</b> highest court for civil cased in Calcutta<br>

        <h2 id="#rajanandkumar">1775, Raja Nand Kumar</h2>
        <h4>Reasons for the suspicion surrounding this trial court</h4>
        <dl>
            Raja Nand Kumar has accused Warren Hastings(Governor-General of Bengal) for corruption and financial misconduct<br><br>
            <b>Supreme Court against Nand Kumar</b><br>
            Then British court accused Nand kumar for forgery and was tried by the newly established Supreme Court in Calcutta<br>
            Evidence presented against Nand Kumar was questionable, and the legal proceedings were perceived as biased.<br>
            Sir Elijah Impey(Chief Justice of the Supreme Court), was a close friend of Warren Hastings, refused bail to Nand Kumar<br>
            Nand Kumar was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. This was called <u>Blatant miscarriage of justice</u><br>
            Trial and execution of Nand Kumar led to significant public outcry and protests<br>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            Trial raised serious questions about the independence and integrity of the newly established judicial system under British rule.

        <dl>
            Process of compiling and systematizing laws into written code<br>
        </dl>
        <h3>Importance of Codification in the 19th Century</h3>
        <dl>
            1. Legal Clarity and Consistency: Prior to codification, laws were often scattered across various sources,
             including(statutes, customary laws, judicial decisions, and royal decrees)<br>
            2. Industrial Revolution and Social Change: Codified laws could be updated and expanded to address emerging 
            issues related to commerce, labor, property rights<br>
            3. Colonial Expansion: European colonial powers, such as Britain and France, were expanding their empires, 
            including in regions like India and Africa. Codification helped impose a uniform legal system in colonies<br>
            4. Codification was seen as a means to modernize legal systems<br>
            5.  The success of landmark legal codes, such as the Napoleonic Code (1804) in France, inspired other countries 
            to undertake similar codification efforts
        </dl>
        <h3>Examples of Codification Efforts in the 19th Century:</h3>
        <dl>
            1. Napoleonic Code (1804):<br>
            &ensp; it systematized French civil law(individual rights, property rights, and secular legal principles.).<br>
            2. 1860 (Indian Penal Code):<br>
            &ensp; Drafted by Lord Macaulay.replaced a diverse set of laws influenced by various customs, traditions, and colonial regulations<br>
            3. 1900. German Civil Code (BGB)<br>
            &ensp; systematic approach to codifying civil law, influencing legal systems in Europe and beyond.
        </dl>
        <h3>Development and codification Hindu Law</h3>
        <dl>
            (1757-1857)Early Period:<br>
            &ensp; Hindu and Muslim laws were administered by traditional authorities and local courts.<br>
            &ensp; In inheritance, marriage, caste, and other religious usages, Hindus would be governed by their own laws.<br>
            Role of Pundits:<br>
            &ensp; British judges often relied on Hindu pundits (scholars) to interpret and apply Hindu law, they refer Manusmriti, Mitakshara, and Dayabhaga.<br>
            Translation of Legal Texts:<br>
            &ensp; British initiated the translation of key Hindu legal texts to facilitate their understanding and application in courts. 
            For example, Nathaniel Brassey Halhed’s translation of the Manusmriti in 1776.<br><br>

            (1857-1947)Later Period<br>
            Codification Efforts:<br>
            &ensp; British recognized the need to codify Hindu law to ensure consistency and reduce reliance on pundits, whose interpretations could vary.<br>
            Specific Legislative Acts:<br>
            &ensp; Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856: Allowed Hindu widows to remarry.<br>
            &ensp; Hindu Gains of Learning Act, 1930: Clarified that income earned through learning or education was the exclusive property of the individual who earned it.<br>
            Judicial Precedents:<br>
            &ensp; British courts began to play a significant role in shaping Hindu law
        </dl>

        <h3>Development and Codification of Muhammadan (Islamic) Law</h3>
        <dl>
            (1757-1857)Early Period:<br>
            &ensp; Similar to Hindu law, Islamic law was initially administered according to traditional practices with 
            qadis (Islamic judges) and muftis (Islamic legal scholars) playing key roles<br>
            &ensp; Translation of Legal Texts. For instance, Charles Hamilton’s translation of Hedaya, a major Hanafi legal text, in 1791.
            <br><br>

            (1857-1947)Later period<br>
            Codification Efforts.<br>
            &ensp; The British made several attempts to codify Islamic law, focusing on areas where inconsistencies or conflicts arose.<br>
            Specific Legislative Acts:<br>
            &ensp;The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937: Ensured that all Muslims in India would be governed by Islamic
             law in matters of personal law, replacing customary practices that had crept in over time.<br>
            Judicial Precedents:<br>
            &ensp; British courts also influenced the development of Islamic law through landmark judgments.
