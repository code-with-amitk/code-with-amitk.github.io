        <h2 id="what">What is Replication?</h2>
        <dl>
          Keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines. Each node that stores the copy is called Replica.
        </dl>
        <h3>Advantages of Replication</h3>
        <dt>
          1. Parallel Processing: : In the master-slave model, all writes and updates happen in master
          nodes; whereas, read operations are distributed across slave nodes. This model improves
          performance because it allows more queries to be processed in parallel.<br>
          2. Reliability: If one of database servers is destroyed by a natural disaster(eg: earthquake),
          do not need to worry about data loss because data is replicated across multiple locations<br>
          3. High availability: By replicating data across different locations, your website remains in
          operation even if a database is offline as you can access data stored in another database
          server.

              <b>What</b><br>
              &ensp;1 node is designated as Leader/master. Client does RW operations with master, and only Read on any of slave.<br>
              &ensp;Master stores session in it'd DB 1st then master writes(or slave reads) data to 
              replicas/slaves(as replication log or change stream).<br>
              <br>
              <b>Disadvantage</b><br>
              &ensp; a. Logic is required to promote slave to master(when master fails)<br>
              &ensp; b. If high number of slaves, more write operations can lead to replication lag.

              <b>What?</b><br>
              There are 2 or more leader nodes. Client can write to any 1 of leader. 
              Other leaders will act as slave and read all data from present leader.<br>
