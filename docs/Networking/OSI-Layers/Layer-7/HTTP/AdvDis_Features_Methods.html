    <h2 id="what">What is HTTP</h2>
    <dl>
      Client-server/Request-Response protocol. Default port 80, other can be used. Uses TCP, does not use UDP. 
      Googleâ€™s QUIC uses HTTP over UDP<br>
      HTTP Clients: Web-browser, Any process can create socket and get information from server.
    </dl>

    <h2 id="features">Features of HTTP</h2>
    <dl>
      1. CONNECTIONLESS: HTTP-client(browser) initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. 
      server processes the request and re-establishes the connection with the client to send a response back.<br>
      2. MEDIA INDEPENDENT: Any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content.<br>
      3. STATELESS: No session information is stored either by client or server.<br>
      4. Persistant & Parallel Connection: 2 access requests can be sent back-2-back without waiting for response to arrive.      
    </dl>
    <pre><code>
      Client                         Server
      <-----TCP-3-way-handshake---->
      --------GET Page-1----------->
      --------GET Page-2----------->
      <-------Page-1---------------
      <-------Page-2---------------      
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="adv">Advatanges, Disadvatanges/pitfalls of HTTP</h2>
    <h3>Advatanges</h3>
    <dl>
      1. Flexible. Whenever there are additional capabilities needed by an application, HTTP has the capability to extend. These can include Flash players and Acrobat reader.<br>
      2. Less connections. With HTTP2 and HTTP3 multiple requests can be sent in 1 packet.<br>
      3. Network BW: Less dues to less connections as HTTP2, HTTP3 sends multiple requests in 1 connection.<br>
      4. Error reporting: Reports errors without closing the TCP connection.
    </dl>

    <h3>DisAdvatanges</h3>
    <dl>
      1. Can only be used for point to point connection.<br>
      2. Does not have push capabilities as in [Long Pooling or server sent Events](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/WebServer_to_WebClient_Connection_Methods).<br>
      3. HTTPv2 does not offer reliable exchange (without retry logic).      
    </dl>

    <h2 id="methods">HTTP Methods</h2>
    <dl>
      Method? Operations are called methods for requesting web page or content.<br>
      Safe methods? Those which donot change state of server. Eg: GET, HEAD<br>
      Read only methods? GET, OPTIONS, HEAD<br>
      Idempotent methods? A operation that will produce the same results if executed once 
      or multiple times. Eg: GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS<br>
      CRUD Operations: Protocol should support minimum these operations/methods.      
    </dl>
    <pre><code>
      Create = POST
      Read = GET
      Update = PUT
      Delete = DELETE
    </code></pre>
