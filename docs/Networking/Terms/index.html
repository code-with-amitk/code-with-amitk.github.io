                captive portal is a web page that users must interact with before accessing a public network. 
                It's often used by public venues that offer free Wi-Fi, such as airports, hotels, and coffee shops

        <h3 id="whycloud">Why Cloud?</h3>
        <dt>
            - Cloud adoption is all time high and constantly growing. 
            The demand for remote workforce is increasing and per Gartner research demand for remote working is set to increase 30% by 2030, 
            post coronavirus pandemic which has forced world wide organizations to adopt a hybrid working model.<br>
            - All application(FaaS, SaaS, Sharepoint, office365) as moving to cloud and organizations want secure, seemless access by all employees(in office, home, branch offices)
            to these applications
        </dt>
        <br>
        <dd>
            Saas(Software as Service): Host S/W on cloud VM. SaaS is accessed using a thin client or by browser. Eg: Gmail, Salesforce, Office 365<br>
            PaaS(Platform as Service): Provide Dashboard. upload button is provided you can upload your website. Write your code, 
            Cloud provider will take care of it. Eg: GAE(Google App engine), Heroku, AWS(Elastic Bean stawk)<br>
            IaaS(Infrastructure as Service): Provide VM. Cloud provider will give access to OS of server/VM, user can 
            install/remove/do anything on Server. Highest control. Eg: 	AWS, GCP, Azure

            The Gartner Magic Quadrant is a research report that helps identify and assess the top 10-12 players in a specific global market<br>
            It provides a visual representation of different types of technology providers and their position in fast-growing markets.

        <h4 id="sase">SASE(Secure Access Service Edge)</h4>
        <dd>
            - Gartner gave SASE term in year 2019 to define networking and security capabilities into a single service sitting on cloud.
            Providing network security at wide-area networking (WAN) delivered as a cloud service.<br>
            - All users in branch office, home, roaming(airport) if he want to access any of cloud service()
            he will go thru SASE.<br>
            - Examples:

        - Consider a multinational corporation(HCL Tech) with branch offices across different regions.
        Each office requires secure access to the corporate network and cloud-based applications.<br>
        - With SASE, security and all services delivered from cloud, allowing employees to securely connect to the corporate network and cloud applications from any location using a unified and consistent security policy

            - Consider a retail chain(Relaince) with numerous branch offices across the country. <br>
            - Each branch office(store) requires reliable connectivity to Central or HQ services(eg: DB) to POS devices.<br>
            - 1 solution is to use <a href="/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-2.5/mpls.html">MPLS</a> for connectivity 
            between stores and headquarters(But this is expensive), other is SD-WAN.<br>

            It can detect user behavior anomalies(Eg: from Active Directory event logs).<br>
            (Early Days) SIEM platforms were log management tools, They enabled real-time monitoring and analysis of security-related events.<br>
            (Present Day) SIEM software has evolved to incorporate user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) & other advanced AI methods
            to identify anomalous behaviors and indicators of advanced threats.

        <dt>1. Collect logs(from wide range of sources(on-premises and cloud environments)<br>
            2. Consolidate and sort to identify threats and adhere to data compliance requirements.

            SIEM consolidates its analysis into a single, central dashboard where security teams monitor activity, 
            triage alerts, identify threats and initiate response or remediation.
